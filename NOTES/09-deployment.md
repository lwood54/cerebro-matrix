## Netflify

Netflify really does make deployment easy.
But we do need to take care of accessing the environment variables.

1. go to settings in the project main section
2. click on "Build & deploy"
3. look for "Build environment variables"
4. Now we can add they key value pairs from our .env.development file
5. click save
6. navigate to the deploy tab
7. click on trigger deploy
